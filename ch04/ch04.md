Run the container under an alias:

`docker run --name <NAME> <CONTAINER>`

---
Rename the container:

`docker rename <NEW_NAME> <OLD_NAME>`

---
Also, inspect it with:

for logs: `docker logs <CONTAINER>`

for more details: `docker inspect <CONTAINER>` (JSON format)

---
Extract fields from `docker inspect`:

**1st METHOD**: `jq`

For inspecting the JSON you *could* use `grep` or `awk`. 

Better to use `JQ` when it comes to JSONs if you want to inspect the result from the shell.

So, for example:

`docker inspect <CONTIANER> | jq ` will prettify it.

`jq .[0].Created` to get the first element of that array (output of `docker inspect` is an array) and get the `Created` field.

Can use `-r` for the raw value, without colors.

**2nd METHOD**: `--format` 

use Go template expressions.

`docker inspect --format '{{ .Created }}' <CONTAINER_1> <CONTAINER_2>` 

---
You can also label the docker containers you run:

`docker run -label "<LABEL_NAME>=<LABEL>` (or just `-l`)

Also, docker can differentiate between labels if you just leave the `LABEL` tag empty. Therefore, just having a `LABEL_NAME`.

Also, you can filter after the owner with `docker ps --filter label=<LABEL_NAME>=<LABEL>`, for example.

Container process vs host process
