Regarding the `hello` dir -

In production we would use WORKDIR. And the gcc official image, probably.

Right now it's messy.
You can check the folder structure by `docker run -ti hello bash` => `ls` and look that up for yourself.
---
you can see the ps tree in the container.

`ps faux | less`

---
should use the json syntax in commands like
`CMD ./<something>` if it is the entrypoint for something and
you want to use `CTRL+C` for the stop signal. With that syntax,
you don't operate on the `/bin/sh -c <COMMAND>` and therefore,
not stopping your server.

---
use `-y` tag in the docker command in order to bypass input prompts.
