Regarding the `hello` dir -

In production we would use WORKDIR. And the gcc official image, probably.

Right now it's messy.
You can check the folder structure by `docker run -ti hello bash` => `ls` and look that up for yourself.

---
you can see the ps tree in the container.

`ps faux | less`

---
should use the json syntax in commands like
`CMD ./<something>` if it is the entrypoint for something and
you want to use `CTRL+C` for the stop signal. With that syntax,
you don't operate on the `/bin/sh -c <COMMAND>` and therefore,
not stopping your server.

---
use `-y` tag in the docker command in order to bypass input prompts.

---
`exec` in bash does not fork in another shell. Essentially, it does not create another process.

This is useful because sometimes we can use exec and bypass using the json syntax in `CMD` commands, for example.

---
pay attention when using the `COPY`command - as it copies the contents of a folder. For files it does not really matter.
