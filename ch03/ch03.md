Regarding the `hello` dir -

In production we would use WORKDIR. And the gcc official image, probably.

Right now it's messy.
You can check the folder structure by `docker run -ti hello bash` => `ls` and look that up for yourself.

---
you can see the ps tree in the container.

`ps faux | less`

---
should use the json syntax in commands like
`CMD ./<something>` if it is the entrypoint for something and
you want to use `CTRL+C` for the stop signal. With that syntax,
you don't operate on the `/bin/sh -c <COMMAND>` and therefore,
not stopping your server.

---
use `-y` tag in the docker command in order to bypass input prompts.

---
`exec` in bash does not fork in another shell. Essentially, it does not create another process.

This is useful because sometimes we can use exec and bypass using the json syntax in `CMD` commands, for example.

---
pay attention when using the `COPY`command - as it copies the contents of a folder. For files it does not really matter.

---
Reducing image size: 
- **Collapsing layers** aka chaining commands (e.g `RUN <COMMAND_1> && <COMMAND2 && ..`). By using `&&` and not `;` if one command fails, the rest will fail as well.
- **Squashing the image**. Which takes quite a bit of time as well. And you don't use the caching system. You do get a single layer image so I suppose for small images that's fine.
- **Multi-stage builds**. Great way of taking advantage of the caching system docker already has and approaching the problem in a proper manner.

---
Multi-stage build:

Start a new phase of the build with: `FROM <IMG>`

You can use:  `COPY --from=0 <FILE_TO_BE_COPIED>`.
The from syntax can include the nr. of the layer (0-N) or the alias if you used `AS`. 

---

Take into consideration that each dockerfile command is a new layer that has the size of the *sum of previous layers* + current layer.
Also, try to build the more important layers, the ones that won't be changed first so you can profit off of the caching system and make the build quicker. 

---
Pushing the image into dockerhub:


`docker tag <CURRENT_IMAGE_NAME> <NEW_IMAGE_NAME>` *

`docker login`

`docker push <PATH>`

---
Building binaries in the most efficient way:

You can check the properties of a file with the `file <FILE>` command in the shell. There, you can see that some binaries are *dynamically linked*.
Which means, that your binary actually depends (linked) on a few libraries to run. 

You can check which libraries with `ldd <FILE>`. In a scratch container you could install these files that your binary depends on. It's quite brittle though. 

**OR**

You can just statically build them with the tag `LDFLAGS=-static` in the shell.

---
For debugging the layer stages of the build:

You can use `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0` before the `docker` command to enter the layers one by one.
