tag `-t` to name it other than 324ijdsaa to something;
`docker build .` => takes the curr dir; packages it up; sends it to
the docker engine; docker engine executes the build.

`docker build . -t something`

---
can use `-q` or `-l` to see the last containers built
or join the commands -ql => docker ps -ql (container id and last container)
can also attach to the last one; eg: `docker attach $(docker ps -ql)`
if you are on debian/powershell you can use `$()` or ``

`docker ps`

---
can override the entrypoint and assuming you use a
debian system and have a sh you can interact with it
if you also add the tags `-ti` and `container name`.

`docker --entrypoint bash`

---
can look up images

`docker search`

---
layers

`docker history`

---
can build without using cache so that it rebuild it and
you have the latest version of the dependencies

`docker build --no-cache`

---

Difference between image(R/O) and container(R/W).
If you have ENTRYPOINT and CMD in dockerfile and pass in the run a command it will override CMD.
