`docker run -d -P nginx`

The `-P` stands for `--publish all` and publishes all the exposed ports by that image to random ports. Docker picks them.
You can see which ports it picked with `docker  ps -l`.

You can also access it from the shell with `curl localhost:<PORT>`, for example.

You can also use `-p` to set the port used by your image: `docker run -d -p <HOST_PORT_NR>:<CONTAINER_PORT_NR> <DOCKER_IMAGE>`

There are a couple of network drivers that you can use on your containers:
You select this by using `docker run --net ..`

**bridge(default)**

The container gets a virtual `eth0` interface (virtual network card). It also has a `lo` loopback interface.

Docker is creating a pair of `veth` interfaces; one on the host and one on the container. 
You can actually check this by `sudo apt-get install bridge-utils` if you are running on a unix machine and then using `brctl show`. You'll see the linux bridge `docker0`.

**none**

You only have the `lo` interface now. Can't really connect to the network from that container environment. 

**host**

It essentially accesses the network interfaces of the host. All of them. It can bind any port/any address.


**container**

This re-uses the network stack of another container.
You connect to it by running `docker run --net container:<CONTAINER_ID>`

The containers communicate over the `lo` interface.
